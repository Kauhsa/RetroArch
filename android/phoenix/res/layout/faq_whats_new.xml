* [NEStopia] Famicom Disk System support. For Android users - put disksys.rom
into the same folder as the FDS ROM you're trying to load. For everyone else -
put disksys.rom into your system directory.\n
  - Y Button will switch sides of a disk.\n
  - If you get any problems of the sort DISK A / B ERR 07' - pressing Y button again or letting it run its course should do it.\n
  - NOTE - Famicom Disk System loading is slow, so you might be tempted to fast forward through most of it. However, I'd advise caution when doing so and to savestate regularly in case 'fast forwarding' can negatively affect disk loading.\n
* [FBA core] Various changes/fixes\n
- Hook up Eco Fighters controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons)\n
- Hook up Pnickie controls (Turn 1/Turn 2 bound to L and R buttons - press
one of the buttons to progress beyond start screen)\n
- Hook up Continental Circus controls - Brake 2/Brake 3 (L1/L2 buttons)
and Accelerate 2/Accelerate 3 (R1/R2 buttons)\n
- Hook up Gun Smoke controls - Start button (needed to progress beyond
title screen)\n
- Hook up Mighty Pang controls (P1 Shot1/P1 Shot2/P2 Shot1/P2 Shot2)\n

of RetroArch.\n

* [Android] Input autodetection expanded -\n
  - iControlpad (needs to be tested)\n
* [Unzipping [All consoles/Android]] Moved from rzlib to miniz/minizip -should increase compatibility

        * New 'Calibrate Refresh Rate' option - use this to get an accurate estimation of your screen refresh rate. NOTE: Touch the screen at all times during calibration for more accurate measurements. You might have to slightly tweak the value later on for the best results.\n
        * Added a 'Set OS-reported refresh rate' which should do the same as what 'Sync refreshrate to Screen' previously did. Note 2 users might get better results with this than they will with 'Calibrate refresh rate'.\n
        * Added a built-in help system that should answer a lot of the frequently asked questions.\n
        * Add iCade profiles - two added for now - iPega and Red Samurai\n
        * [Android] Audio resampler now faster\n
        * Input autodetection expanded -\n

        * Better multi-touch controls.\n
        * Ability to set opacity of overlays.\n
        * Shaders bundled (NOTE: need Tegra 4/Exynos5-class GPU for good results).\n
        * Input autodetection expanded -\n
        - Xperia Play (now properly tested on an r800i)\n
        - Madcatz PS3 fighting stick\n
        - Moga IME app (previously would work only on rooted devices with gamepad mode)\n

        * FBA core - fixed a serious bug causing graphic glitches.\n
        * Nestopia core - use mono sound like the real NES.\n
        * Genesis Plus GX - Lunar Eternal Blue (JP) works again.\n
        \n
        r8 (Jan 30, 2013) - VERSION 0.9.8.1\n\n

        \n
        r6 (Jan 29, 2013)\n\n

        - Should fix emu crashing on some devices due to memory mapping issues.\n
        * New system-specific overlays added - on new installs only these new ones will be there and the old bad ones will no longer be there. On pre-existing installs - just use the new ones - they should be much better. If you're still unsatisfied, nothing is stopping you from editing these files yourself with a text editor and an image editor - it's really simple to do.\n
        * New 'custom binding' when you turn off 'Configuration Autodetect Enable' - allows you to manually put in button mapping in case we don't support your pad. Note - it's probably more reliable right now to select the 'keycode' from the dropdown list instead of pressing the button on the pad.\n
